                                        Christopher Robin, fictional character, an English boy whose adventures with Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet,<br> and other animals are the basis of the stories in the classic children’s books Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) <br> and The House at Pooh Corner (1928) by A.A. Milne. The character was based on the author’s young son. <br> In the stories, Christopher Robin is usually the voice of reason and the character who can <br> be relied on to get the animals out of the predicaments they get themselves into. He is also a character <br> in the verse collections When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927).

                                        The main character, Winnie-the-Pooh (sometimes called simply Pooh or Edward Bear), is a good-natured,  <br>yellow-furred, honey-loving bear who lives in the Forest surrounding the Hundred  <br>Acre Wood (modeled after Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England). His companions are Eeyore, a  <br>gloomy gray donkey; Piglet, a timid pig; Owl, a pontificating bird; the meddlesome Rabbit; and  <br>Kanga, an energetic kangaroo whose inquisitive baby, Roo, lives in her pouch.

                                        Tigger is a fictional character, an anthropomorphic stuffed tiger. He was originally introduced in  <br>the 1928 story collection The House at Pooh Corner, the sequel to the 1926 book Winnie-the-Pooh  <br>by A. A. Milne. Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's  <br>stuffed toy animals. He appears in the Disney animated versions of Winnie the Pooh and has also  <br>appeared in his own film, The Tigger Movie (2000).

                                        Eeyore, fictional character, a donkey in several popular children’s stories by A.A. Milne. Eeyore,  <br>whose tail is attached by a nail, is one of Christopher Robin’s many toy animals whose adventures  <br> are detailed in the stories in Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928).  <br> A melancholy misanthrope, Eeyore frequently makes bitter, self-deprecating comments  <br> that make him an excellent foil for Winnie-the-Pooh, the affectionate, bumbling Bear of Very Little Brain.

                                        Though Pooh and the others don't seem to mind Piglet's phobias and happily bring him along and/or  <br>protect him through every adventure, Piglet is noticeably embarrassed and ashamed of his dominate <br> cowardliness, and many stories have revolved around him making attempts to overcome his fears.  <br>When it comes to adventuring, Piglet is somewhat of a reluctant hero, as he typically likes to  <br>avoid any potential danger by staying home, only to tag along out of fear of disappointing his  <br>friends. Though he's far from the bravest animal, he has successfully come through for his friends on  <br>numerous occasions. This is mostly due to the fact that Piglet is surprisingly crafty and  <br>harbors impressive physical strength. He's also rather creative and inventive, being able to  <br>create contraptions out of whatever is around him, to use to his and his friends' advantage.

                                        Rabbit lives in a large tree in the Hundred Acre Wood, surrounded by an expansive vegetable garden.  <br>When not adventuring with Pooh and the others, Rabbit mainly spends his time either tending to  <br>his crops or indulging in some of his other hobbies like reading and cleaning. He is also a  <br>harvester of honey, which often leads to unwanted visits from a hungry Pooh Bear.

                                        Kanga is easily the most down-to-earth resident of the Hundred Acre Wood, so much so that she rarely  <br>joins the madcap exploits of her friends. Being a mother, Kanga is sweet and nurturing to both  <br>Roo and the others. She is also wise to some degree and shares this wisdom with other residents, <br> such as Piglet.

                                        Roo takes after Tigger in that he is spirited and adventurous. He acts his age, being curious and  <br>energetic. He is also optimistic and fearless; when he and Tigger were stuck atop a tall tree,  <br>Roo remained calm and upbeat throughout the entire ordeal while Tigger was petrified. Another  <br>example is the time Roo was caught in a river. Rather than panicking, he remained happy-go-lucky,  <br>despite how worried the adults were.

                                        Though Owl is indeed an intellectual, his intelligence is somewhat questionable, as well as his <br> ability to read, as twice he misread messages from Christopher Robin and believed the boy was in  <br>danger, causing unnecessary worry in Pooh and friends, and sometimes even almost getting them  <br> killed. It should be noted, however, that Owl has some legitimate ability to read and write, <br> though Christopher Robin's juvenile spelling and grammar are causing Owl confusion.
